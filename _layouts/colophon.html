<h1>Colophon</h1>

<p>
  The <tt>tamouse-theme</tt> is based on the standard Jekyll <tt>minima</tt> theme.
  I created it especially to use on my <a href="http://tamouse.org">http://tamouse.org</a>
  family of
  websites, at least the ones that are using Jekyll.
</p>

<p>
  I am using the following font collection:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eczar for the base font</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: 'Tillana', cursive;">Tillana</span> for cursive text</li>
  <li><tt>Space Mono</tt> for monospaced text</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: 'Work Sans', sans-serif;">Work Sans<span> for headings and for buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The design is my own, although certainly remeniscient of `minima` but these things do tend to be pretty common,
  with an eye towards mobile-first design.
</p>
